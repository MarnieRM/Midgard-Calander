It is a day of oaths, calling up of peasant levies, and launching a season of raids, war, and commerce. The holiday stretches over three days: one to travel to the festival, then a day for swearing of oaths and contracts, then a day of blessings and prayer to Mavros before the march to war. The holiday is widely celebrated in the Magdar Kingdom, Bourgund, Verrayne, and Melana, and serves as an initiation for young warriors, who fight \"Mustering Bouts\" against each other to crown a \"Chosen of Mavros.\" The holiday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s variable date is declared by the local priest of Thor, Perun, or Mavros. Given weather and climate, the dates of the holiday depend on the condition of the roads and rivers. In the sunny south, Mustering can take place in the first week of Springmelt (or even the last week of Deep Winter). In the north, Mustering rarely takes place in Springmelt, and the holiday more often ocurs in the first or second week of Sowing."

Young and old alike celebrate the rites together, making the festival as much about community building as religious observance. \nThe rites of Porevit and Yarila forbid payment for affection, so the courtesans and lovers for sale see the Spring Festival as a day off, a chance to celebrate love instead of simply selling it. Anyone seeking partners offers them the finest flower or bouquet they can afford, or sometimes a simple garland. Even those who live alone or celibate often receive flowers from admirers or friends, and some describe the city as buried in petals. \nAmong many young people in the city, the Spring Festival commonly results in weddings at Midwinter and/or births the following spring. Even when lacking the vows, the births carry no shame; children born in the springtime to the brides and grooms of Porevit and Yarila are considered lucky. Those born precisely on the winter solstice are always invited to join the Green Gods' priesthood and enter into the druidic mysteries at the age of 10 or 11. Though dedicated to the Green Gods, Lada also gains from this festival, as many a new love often blooms here."
